Chapter 3: My work And those dimensions of reality into which it takes me
第三章: 我的工作以及它带我进入的现实维度。
Now I have friends, as you do.
现在我和你一样有朋友了。
Though my friendships may be longer-standing.
虽然我的友谊可能存在得更久。
You must understand that we experience our own reality in quite a different manner than you do.
你们必须明白，我们体验自己现实的方式与你们完全不同。
We are aware of what you would call our past selves,
我们意识到你们所说的过去的自我，
the personalities we have adopted in various other existences.
以及我们在其他各种存在中所采用的那些性格。
Because we use telepathy,
因为我们使用心灵感应，
we can hide little from one another,
我们几乎无法彼此隐藏什么，
even if we wished to.
即使我们愿意这样做。
This, I am sure, may seem an invasion of privacy to you,
我确信，这对你们来说可能看起来像是对隐私的侵犯，
and yet I assure you that even now none of your thoughts are hidden
然而我向你保证，即使是现在，你们的任何想法也不会被隐藏，
but are known quite clearly to your family and friends,
它们都被你的亲友们十分清楚地知道，
and, I may add, unfortunately, to those you consider enemies as well.
我还要补充，不幸的是，它们对那些你认为是敌人的人也同样如此。
You were simply not aware of this fact.
你只是没有意识到这一点。
This does not mean that each of us is like an open book to another;
这并不意味着我们每个人对他人来说都是一本打开的书；
quite the contrary.
恰恰相反。
There is such a thing as mental etiquette—mental manners.
存在一种精神礼仪——心理礼节。
We are far more aware of our own thoughts than you are;
我们比你们更清楚自己的思想；
we realize our freedom to choose our thoughts,
我们意识到选择思想的自由，
and we choose them with discrimination and finesse.
我们在选择时带着分辨力与技巧。
The power of our thoughts has been made clear to us
我们的思想力量已被证明，
through trial and error in other existences.
这是通过在其他存在中的反复尝试得来的。
We have discovered that no one can escape the vast creativity of the mental image or of emotion.
我们发现，没有人能逃脱心象或情感的巨大创造力。
This does not mean that we are not spontaneous, or that we must deliberate between one thought and another
这并不意味着我们不具有自发性，或必须在各种思想之间反复权衡，
with anxious concern that one might be negative or destructive;
忧虑哪一种想法可能是消极或破坏性的；
that, in your terms, is behind us.
用你们的话说，这已成为过去。
Our psychological structure does mean that we can communicate in far more varied forms than those with which you are familiar.
我们的心理结构意味着我们可以用比你们熟悉的更多样的形式进行交流。
However, pretend, for example,
然而，举例来说，假设，
that you meet a childhood friend whom you have long forgotten.
你遇见了一个你早已忘记的童年朋友。
Now you may have little in common,
现在你们可能无甚共同之处，
yet you may enjoy a fine afternoon's discussion centered on old teachers and classmates,
然而你们仍可能围绕旧时的老师和同学，有一个愉快的下午交流，
and establish a certain rapport.
并建立起某种融洽关系。
So when I meet another, I may be able to relate to him much better on the basis of a particular past-life experience,
因此，当我遇到另一个人时，我也许能基于某一特定的前世经历，与他建立更好的联系，
even though, in my present life, we have little in common.
即使在我的今生里，我们几乎没有共同点。
We may have known each other, for example, as entirely different people in the fourteenth century,
例如，我们可能在十四世纪以完全不同的身份相识，
and we may communicate very nicely by discussing those experiences,
通过讨论那些经历我们也许能很好地沟通，
much as you and your hypothetical childhood friend establish rapport by remembering your past.
正如你和假想中的童年朋友通过回忆过去建立融洽关系一样。
We will be quite aware that we are ourselves, however;
然而我们会十分清楚地意识到，我们仍是我们自己；
the multidimensional personalities who share a more or less common environment at one level of our existence.
在我们存在的某一层面上，作为多维人格，我们共享或多或少相同的环境。
As you will see, this analogy is a rather simple one; that will do only for now,
正如你将看到的，这个类比相当简单；暂且就这样吧，
because past, present and future do not really exist in those terms.
因为在那种层面上，过去、现在和未来并不以你们理解的方式存在。
Our experience, however, does not include the time divisions with which you are familiar.
然而，我们的体验并不包含你们所熟悉的时间划分。
We have far more friends and associates than you do,
我们的朋友与伙伴远比你们多，
simply because we are aware of varying connections across what we call, for now, past incarnations.
这是因为我们意识到在我们目前所称的过去化身之间存在各种联系。
Of course we therefore have more knowledge at our fingertips, so to speak.
当然，可以说我们因此掌握了更多知识。
There is no period of time in your terms that you can mention which some of us have not at some point experienced;
在你们的时间观念里，几乎没有哪个时期是我们中有人未曾经历的；
and many of us carry within our memories the indelible experiences that were gained in those particular contexts.
许多人在记忆中保留着在那些特定环境中获得的不可磨灭的经历。
We do not feel the need to hide our emotions or thoughts from others,
我们不觉得有必要向他人隐藏情感或想法，
because by now we well recognize the cooperative nature of all consciousness and reality.
因为到现在我们已充分认识到所有意识与现实的合作本性。
We are highly motivated; could spirits be anything else?
我们充满动力；灵体还能是什么样子呢？
Simply because we have at our command the full use of our energy,
只是因为我们可以完全掌控我们的能量，
it is not diverted into conflicts nor frittered away,
它不会被用于冲突，也不会被浪费掉，
but utilized for those unique and individual purposes that are a basic part of our psychological experience.
而是用于那些作为我们心理体验基本组成部分的独特且个人化的目的。
Each whole self, or multidimensional personality, has its own purposes, missions, and creative endeavors
每一个完整的自我或多维人格都有自己的目标、使命和创造性的追求，
that are initial and basic parts of itself, and that determine those qualities that make it eternally valid and eternally seeking.
这些目标是其内在的基本组成部分，并决定了使其永恒有效与不断追求的品质。
We are finally free to utilize our energy in those directions.
我们终于可以自由地在这些方向上运用我们的能量。
We face many challenges of a quite momentous nature,
我们面临许多颇为重大的挑战，
and we realize that our purposes are not only important in themselves but also for the surprising offshoots that develop in our efforts to pursue them.
我们意识到，我们的目标不仅自身重要，而且在追求这些目标的过程中会产生意想不到的衍生效果。
In working for our purposes we realize we are blazing trails that can also be used by others.
在为目标而努力时，我们意识到自己正在开辟别人也能利用的道路。
Certainly I suspect—and I do—that the purposes themselves will have surprising results,
我确实怀疑——也相信——这些目标本身会产生令人惊讶的结果，
astounding consequences that we have never realized, which will merely lead to new avenues.
令人震惊的后果我们此前未曾预见，这些只会引向新的道路。
Realizing this helps us to keep a sense of humor.
意识到这一点有助于我们保持幽默感。
When one has been born and has died many times,
当一个人曾多次出生与死亡时，
expecting extinction with each death,
每次死亡都曾期待着彻底消灭，
and when this experience is followed by the realization that existence still continues,
当这种经历之后人们意识到存在仍在延续时，
a sense of the Divine Comedy enters in.
神圣的喜剧感便随之涌入。
We are beginning to learn the creative joy of play.
我们开始学会玩耍的创造性乐趣。
I believe, for example, that all creativity and consciousness are born in the quality of play as opposed to work,
例如，我相信所有的创造力与意识都源于玩耍的本质，而非工作，
in the quickened intuitional spontaneity that I see as a constant through all my own existences,
在那种加速的直觉自发性中，我认为它贯穿我所有的存在，
and in the experience of those I know.
并在我所认识的人的经验中亦是如此。
I communicate with your dimension, for example, not by willing myself to your level of reality,
举例来说，我与贵维度交流，并非通过强迫自己进入你们的现实层面，
but by adjusting my communication to yours,
而是通过将我的交流方式调适到你们的水平，
nor by projecting myself into your level.
也不是把自己投射到你们的层次上。
All of my deaths would have been adventures had I realized what I know now.
如果我意识到我现在所知道的一切，我所有的死亡都将是冒险。
On the one hand, you take life too seriously; on the other, you do not take playful existence seriously enough.
一方面，你把生活看得太重；另一方面，你又不够重视嬉戏般的存在。
We enjoy a sense of play that is highly spontaneous, and yet I suppose you would call it responsible play.
我们享受高度自发的游戏感，但我想你会称之为负责任的玩耍。
Certainly it is creative play.
这当然是一种创造性的游戏。
We play, for example, with the mobility of our consciousness, seeing how far one can send it.
例如，我们会玩弄意识的流动性，看看它能被送到多远。
We are constantly surprised at the products of our own consciousness and of the dimensions of reality through which we can hop.
我们不断为自己意识的产物以及我们能够跳跃的现实维度所惊讶。
It might seem that we use our consciousness idly in such play, and yet the pathways we create may continue to exist and be used by others.
在这种游戏中，我们似乎随意使用意识，但我们创造的路径可能会持续存在并被他人利用。
We leave messages for any who come by—mental sign posts.
我们会给经过的人留下信息——心理路标。
We can be highly motivated, therefore, and yet use and understand the creative value of play both as a method of attaining our goals and as a surprising, creative endeavor in itself.
因此，我们既充满动力，又能运用并理解游戏的创造性价值：既是实现目标的方法，也是本身令人惊喜的创造性实践。
Now, in my work as a teacher, I travel into many dimensions of existence, even as a traveling professor might give lectures in various states or countries; here, however, the resemblance ends.
现在，作为一名教师，我进入存在的许多维度，正如巡回教授可能在不同州或国家讲学；然而，在此类比到此为止。
Largely, before I can begin to work I must set up preliminary psychological structures and learn to know my pupils.
在很大程度上，在我开始工作之前，我必须建立初步的心理结构并了解我的学生。
I must have a thorough knowledge of the particular system of reality in which my pupil operates—of his or her system of thought, the symbols that are meaningful, and the stability of the pupil's personality, which must be correctly gauged by me.
我必须透彻了解学生所处的特定现实体系——他们的思维体系、那些有意义的符号，以及由我来准确评估的学生性格的稳定性。
The needs of that personality cannot be ignored but must be taken into consideration; the pupil must be encouraged but not overextended while development continues.
这种人格的需求不可忽视，必须予以考虑；在发展过程中应鼓励学生，但不可过度施压。
My material must be presented in such a way that it makes sense in the context in which the pupil understands reality, particularly in the early stages; great care must be utilized even before serious learning can begin.
我的内容必须以能让学生在其理解现实的语境中理解的方式呈现，尤其在早期阶段；即使在正式学习开始前，也应极为谨慎。
All levels of the personality develop at a more or less constant rate.
人格的各层面大致以相对恒定的速率发展。
Often the material I present will initially be given without any signs of my presence, seemingly as a startling revelation.
我呈现的材料常在最初没有任何我在场的迹象下出现，仿佛突然的启示。
For no matter how carefully I present the material, it is still bound to challenge past ideas that are strongly a part of the pupil's personality.
因为无论我多么谨慎地呈现材料，它仍将挑战那些深植于学生性格的既有观念。
What I say is one thing, but the pupil, of course, is thrust into psychological and psychic behavior and experience that may seem quite alien to him on a conscious level.
我所说的是一回事，但学生当然会被推入在意识层面看起来相当陌生的心理与灵性行为和体验中。
The problems vary according to the system in which my pupil has his or her existence; in your system, for example, and in connection with the woman through whom I now write this book, initial contact on my part was made long before our sessions began.
这些问题因学生所处的系统而异；例如在你们的系统中，关于我通过其写作的这位女性，我的初次接触早在我们的会话开始之前就已发生。
The personality was never consciously aware of the initial meeting; she simply experienced sudden new thoughts, and since she is a poet these appeared as poetic inspirations.
该人格从未有意识地察觉最初的相遇；她只是突然产生新的想法，且由于她是诗人，这些想法以诗意的灵感形式出现。
Some years ago, at a writers' conference, she became involved in circumstances that could have led to her psychic development before she was ready; the psychological climate at that time initiated the conditions, and without realizing what she was about, a friend, Jane, went into a trance.
几年前，在一次作家大会上，她卷入了一些在她尚未准备好时就可能导致她心灵发展进程的情形；当时参与者的心理氛围促成了这些条件，而在不自知的情况下，一位名叫简的朋友进入了恍惚状态。
I had known of her psychic gifts since childhood, but the necessary insights were channeled through her poetry until the personality attained the background needed in this particular case.
我从她童年起就知道她的灵视天赋，但必要的洞见通过她的诗作来传达，直到她的人格获得了在此特殊情况下所需的背景。
I was informed and saw to it that the episode ended and was not pursued; it was hardly an accidental performance, quite without knowing it, the personality decided to try its wings, figuratively speaking.
我得到通知并确保该插曲结束且不再追究；这并非偶然之举，完全出于不自觉，这个个性可以说决定尝试一下自己的翅膀。
As part of my work, therefore, I have been coaching the young woman in one way or another since her childhood, all of this as a preliminary to the serious work that began with our sessions.
因此，作为我工作的一部分，我自她童年起以或多或少的方式指导她，所有这些都是为我们会话开始的严肃工作做准备。
This is a normal part of my activity across many levels of existence; it is highly diversified work, for personality structures vary while within the systems in which I work there are certain basic similarities in some dimensions.
这是我在多重存在层面上活动的常态；它是高度多样化的工作，因为人格结构各不相同，而在我所工作的系统内，在某些层面上仍有一些基本相似之处。
I would not be equipped to be a teacher simply because the basic concepts of experience would be alien to my nature, and the learning processes themselves might lie outside my own experience.
我并非仅因经验的基本概念与我的本性格格不入就能胜任教师角色，学习过程本身也可能超出我的亲身经历。
Now, your ideas of space are highly erroneous, so in my contacts with your sphere of activity I do not sweep through bright golden skies like some spiritual Superman into your physical domain; I will go into this in a later chapter.
现在，你关于空间的观念大为错误；因此在我与你的活动领域接触时，我并不如某些精神超人般飞越金色天空进入你们的物质领域；我将在后章详述。
Space, as you perceive it, simply does not exist—not only is the illusion of space caused by your own physical perceptive mechanisms, but it is also caused by mental patterns that you have accepted, patterns adopted by consciousness when it reaches a certain stage of evolution within your system.
你所感知的空间根本不存在——空间的幻觉不仅由你们的物理感知机制造成，也由你们所接受的思维模式造成，这些模式在意识达到你们系统内某一进化阶段时被采纳。
When you arrive into physical life, your mind is not a blank waiting for experience to write upon it; you are already equipped with a memory bank far surpassing that of any computer.
当你进入物质生命时，你的心灵并非一张等待经验书写的空白；你已具备一个远超任何计算机的记忆库。
You face your first day upon the planet with skills and abilities already built in, though they may or may not be used, and they are not merely the result of heredity as you think of it.
你在来到这个星球的第一天就拥有内建的技能与能力，尽管这些技能或许会被使用或不被使用，而且它们并非如你们所想仅仅是遗传的结果。
You may think of your soul or entity as some conscious and living divinely inspired computer that programs its own existences and lifetimes; but this computer is so highly endowed with creativity that each of the various personalities or programs spring into consciousness and song and in turn create realities that may have been undreamed of by the computer itself.
你或许会把灵魂视为某种有意识的、活着的、受神启发的计算机，为自己的存在与生命编程；但这台计算机极具创造力，以致其中的各个人格或程序会迸发为意识与歌声，进而创造出计算机本身未曾设想的现实。
Each such personality, however, comes with a built-in idea of the reality in which it will operate, and its mental equipment is highly tailored to meet very specialized environments.
然而，每个人格都带有对其将运作之现实的内在设想，其心理装备高度定制以适应非常特殊的环境。
It has full freedom but must operate within the context of existence to which it has been programmed.
它拥有完全的自由，但必须在其被编程的存在语境中运作。
Within the personality, however, in the more secret recesses, is the condensed knowledge that resides in the computer as a whole.
然而，在人格的较为隐秘的角落里，存在着凝缩的知识，属于整体计算机的储存。
I must emphasize that I am not saying that the solar entity is a computer, but only asking you to look at the matter in this light in order to make several points clear.
我必须强调，我并不是说太阳实体就是一台计算机，而只是请你从这一角度看待此事以澄清若干要点。
Each personality has within it the ability not only to gain a new type of existence in the environment—in your case, in physical reality—but to add creatively to the very quality of its own consciousness.
每个人格不仅有能力在环境中获得新的生存方式——在你们的情形中即物质现实——还能创造性地提升自身意识的品质。
And in so doing, to work its way through the specialized system, breaking the barriers of reality as it knows it.
在此过程中，它通过专门化的系统开辟道路，打破它所知现实的界限。
Now there is a purpose in all this that will also be discussed later; I mentioned this whole subject here because I want you to see that your environment is not real in the terms that you imagine it to be.
这一切有其目的，稍后将进一步讨论；我在此提及整个主题，是要让你明白，你的环境并非如你想象的那样真实。
When you are born, you are already conditioned to perceive reality in a particular manner and to interpret experiences in a very limited but intense range.
当你出生时，你已被条件化以特定方式感知现实，并在一个非常有限却强烈的范围内解释经验。
I must explain this before I can give you an idea of mine, or of those other systems of reality in which I operate.
我必须解释这些，才能让你了解我或我所运作的其他现实系统的观点。
There is no space between my environment and yours, for example—no physical boundaries that separate us.
例如，我的环境与您的环境之间没有空间，也没有把我们隔开的物理界限。
In a very real way, your concept of reality as seen through your physical senses, scientific instruments, or arrived at through deduction bears little resemblance to the facts, and the facts are difficult to explain.
在很大程度上，通过你们的物理感官、科学仪器或推演得出的现实观与事实相去甚远，而这些事实难以解释。
Your planetary systems exist at once simultaneously, both in time and in space;
你们的行星系统在时间与空间上同时共存；
what appears to you as a universe composed of galaxies, stars, and planets at various distances is, basically, an illusion—your senses and your very existence as physical creatures program you to perceive the universe in such a way.
在你们看来由不同距离的星系、恒星与行星组成的宇宙，基本上是一种幻觉——你们的感官以及作为物质生物的存在让你们以那样的方式感知宇宙。
The universe as you know it is your interpretation of events as they intrude upon your three-dimensional reality; the events are mental.
你们所知的宇宙是当事件侵入你们的三维现实时，你们对这些事件的解释；这些事件本质上是精神性的。
This does not mean that you cannot travel to other planets within that physical universe any more than it means you cannot use tables to hold books, glasses, and oranges, although the table has no solid qualities of its own.
这并不意味着在那个物质宇宙中你们无法前往其他星球，就像这并不意味着你不能用桌子放书、玻璃杯和橙子一样，尽管桌子本身并无实体的坚实特性。
When I enter your system, I move through a series of mental and psychic events that you would interpret as space and time; and so often I must use those terms, for I must use your language rather than my own.
当我进入你们的系统时，我穿行于一系列在你们看来是空间与时间的精神与心灵事件；因此我常不得不用那些术语，因为我必须使用你们的语言而非我自己的。
Root assumptions are those built-in ideas of reality of which I spoke—those agreements upon which you base your ideas of existence: space and time, for example. Each system of reality has its own set of such agreements.
根本假设即我所说的关于现实的内在观念——你们构建生存观念所依赖的那些约定，例如空间与时间。每个现实系统都有其自身的一套此类约定。
When I communicate with your system, I must use and understand the root assumptions upon which it is based; as a teacher it is part of my job to understand and use these, and I have had existences in many such systems as part of what you may call my basic training.
当我与你们的系统交流时，我必须使用并理解其所基于的根本假设；作为一名教师，理解并运用这些是我的职责的一部分，我在许多此类系统中的存在是你们所谓基础训练的一部分。
Though in your terms my associates and I had other names for them—the entity or the soul—these are far more creative and complicated in nature than even your religions have ever granted them.
尽管用你们的话来说，我与我的同伴们对它们有其他称谓——实体或灵魂——但它们的本质比你们的宗教所赋予的更具创造性与复杂性。
It utilizes numberless methods of perception and has at its command many other kinds of consciousness.
它采用无数感知方法，并掌控着许多其他形式的意识。
Your idea of the soul is indeed limited by your three-dimensional concepts; your soul can change the focus of its consciousness and use consciousness as you use the eyes in your head.
你对灵魂的概念确实受限于三维观念；你的灵魂可以改变其意识的焦点，并像你使用头上的眼睛一样使用意识。
Now, at my level of existence, I am simply aware of the strange fact that I am not my consciousness; my consciousness is an attribute to be used by me.
现在，在我的存在层面，我只是意识到一个奇特的事实：我不是我的意识；我的意识是被我所使用的属性。
This applies to each of the readers of this book, even though the knowledge may be hidden.
这适用于本书的每一位读者，尽管这一知识可能被隐藏。
Soul or entity, then, is more than consciousness.
因此，灵魂或实体不仅仅是意识。
When I enter your environment I turn my consciousness in your direction and, in one way, I translate what I am into an event that you can understand to some extent, in a much more limited manner.
当我进入你们的环境时，我将意识转向你们，从某种意义上把我的存在转译为你们在某种程度上可以理解的事件，方式更为有限。
Any artist does the same thing when he translates what he is, or a portion of it, into a painting; there is at least an evocative analogy here.
任何艺术家在将其本质或部分本质转化为一幅画时也做同样的事情；这里至少有一个发人深省的类比。
When I enter your system I manifest brain products, yet I enjoy it and often take a physical form in order to sit at the desk and look out the window at the countryside.
当我进入你们的系统时，我会展现出脑力产物，尽管如此我很享受，而且常常采取一种物质形态以便坐在书桌前眺望窗外的乡野。
Now you do the same thing when you sit in your living room, but you do not realize what you are doing, and presently you are somewhat restricted.
当你坐在客厅时你也做着同样的事情，但你未意识到自己在做什么，目前你受到了某些限制。
When my associates and I meet, we often translate each other's thoughts into various shapes and forms that provide pure enjoyment in practice; we have what you might call a game, demanding some expertise, for our own amusement.
当我和同伴相聚时，我们常把彼此的想法转化为各种形状与形式，在实践中获得纯粹的乐趣；我们有一场你可以称之为游戏的活动，需要一定的技巧，纯为自娱自乐。
We see which of us can translate any given thought into the most numerous forms.
我们看看谁能将任何给定的想法转化为最多的形式。
There are such subtle qualities affecting the nature of all thought, such emotional gradations that no one is ever identical; incidentally, no physical object in your system is an exact duplicate of any other—the atoms and molecules that compose any object have their own identities that color and qualify each object.
影响所有思想本质的微妙特质与情感层次，使得每个人都不可能完全相同；顺便提一下，在你们的系统中也没有一个物体是另一个的精确复制——组成物体的原子与分子各有其身份，从而影响并限定每一物体。
You accept and perceive and focus upon continuities and similarities as your perceived physical objects of any kind, and in a very important manner you shut out and ignore dissimilarities of a given field of actuality; therefore you are very highly discriminating, accepting certain qualities and ignoring others.
你接受、感知并关注那些在你看来连续且相似的事物作为任何种类的物理对象，并以一种非常重要的方式屏蔽并忽视某一现实领域的不相似之处；因此你们具有极高的辨别力，接受某些品质而忽略其他品质。
Your body not only changes completely every seven years, for example, but it changes constantly with each breath; within the flesh, atoms and molecules constantly die and are replaced, hormones are in a constant state of motion and alteration, and electromagnetic properties of skin and cell continually leap and change, and even reverse themselves.
例如，你的身体不仅每七年完全改变一次，而且每一次呼吸都在持续变化；在肉体内部，原子与分子不断死亡并被替换，荷尔蒙持续运动与变化，皮肤与细胞的电磁特性不断跳跃变化，甚至会自我逆转。
The physical matter that composed your body a moment ago is different in important ways from the matter that forms your body in this instant.
刚刚组成你身体的物质在重要方面与此刻构成你身体的物质不同。
If you perceived the constant change within your body with as much persistence as you attend to its seemingly permanent nature, then you would be amazed that you ever considered the body as more or less a constant, more or less a cohesive entity.
如果你以与关注身体看似恒常性同等的坚持去感知其内部的持续变化，你会惊讶于曾把身体视为或多或少恒定、较为凝聚的实体。
Even subjectively, you focus upon and indeed manufacture the idea of a relatively stable, relatively permanent conscious self; you stress those ideas, thoughts, and attitudes that you recall from your past experience as your own, completely ignoring those that once were characteristic and now have vanished.
即便在主观上，你也会关注并确立一个相对稳定、相对持久的有意识自我；你强调那些你从过去经历中记忆为自我的想法、思维与态度，完全忽视那些曾经典型但现在已经消失的要素。
Ignoring the fact also that you cannot hold the thought of a moment before in your terms—such a thought vanishes away.
还忽视了一个事实：按你的说法，你无法持有片刻之前的想法——这样的想法会消失。
You try to maintain a constant, relatively permanent physical and subjective self in order to maintain a relatively constant, relatively permanent environment, so you are always in a position of ignoring such change.
你试图维持一个恒定且相对永久的物理与主观自我以维持一个相对恒定、相对持久的环境，因此你总是处于忽视此类变化的立场。
Those that you refuse to acknowledge are precisely those that would give you a much better understanding of the true nature of reality—individual subjectivity and the physical environment that seems to surround you.
你拒绝承认的，恰恰是那些会让你更好理解现实真实本质的要素——个体主观性与看似围绕你的物理环境。
What happens to a thought when it leaves your conscious mind? It does not simply disappear; you can learn to follow, but you are usually frightened of turning your attention away from its intense focus in three-dimensional existence, and therefore it seems that the thought disappears.
当一个想法离开你的意识心时会发生什么？它并不会简单地消失；你可以学会去追寻，但通常你害怕把注意力从在三维存在中那强烈的聚焦上转移，因此这种想法看似消失。
It also seems that your subjectivity has a mysterious unknown quality, and that even your mental life is a sort of insidious dropping-off point—the subjective cliff over which thoughts and memories fall to disappear into nothingness.
你的主观性似乎具有一种神秘的未知性质，甚至你的精神生活也像一种阴险的下落点——主观的悬崖，思想与记忆从上面坠落并消失于虚无。
Therefore, to protect yourself, to protect your subjectivity from drifting, you erect various psychological barriers at what you suppose to be the danger points.
因此，为了保护自己，为了防止主观性漂移，你在你认为危险的点设置了各种心理屏障。
Instead, you can follow these thoughts and emotions simply by realizing that your own reality continues in another direction besides the one which you humanely identify; for these thoughts and emotions that have left your conscious mind will lead you into other environments.
相反，你可以跟随这些想法与情绪，只需意识到你自身的现实在除你通常识别的那个方向之外还继续存在；离开你意识的这些想法与情绪会将你引向其他环境。
These subjective openings, through which thoughts seemed to disappear, are in fact like psychic warps connecting the self that you know with other universes of experience—realities where symbols come to life and thoughts are not denied their potential.
这些主观的开口，思想似乎通过它们消失，实际上像是将你已知自我与其他经验宇宙相连的心灵扭曲——在那些现实中，符号复苏，思想得以发挥其潜能。
There is communication between these other realities and your own in your dream states, and a constant interaction between both systems.
在梦境状态中，这些其他现实与你的现实之间存在交流，两个系统之间持续互动。
If there is any point where your own consciousness seems to elude you or escape you, or if there is any point where your consciousness seems to end, then these are the points where you have set your own psychological and psychic barriers, and these are precisely the areas that you should explore.
如果在任何时刻你的意识似乎逃避你或消失，或在任何时刻你的意识似乎结束，那么那些恰是你设置心理与心灵屏障的点，也正是你应该探索的领域。
Otherwise, you feel as if your consciousness is enclosed within your skull—immobile and constricted—and every lost thought or forgotten memory, at least symbolically, seems like a small death, and such is not the case.
否则，你会感觉自己的意识被封闭在头骨内——无法动弹且受限——每一个丢失的想法或被遗忘的记忆，至少在象征意义上，看似一场小小的死亡，但事实并非如此.
