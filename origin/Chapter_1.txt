Chapter 1 I do not have a physical body, yet i am writing this book
第一章 我没有肉体，却在写这本书
I am a ghost.
我是一位幽灵。
Though I do not approve of the term ghost.
不过我并不赞成用“幽灵”这个词来称呼自己。
It is true that I am usually not seen in physical terms.
确实，人们通常无法用物质形态看到我。
I do not like the word spirit either.
我也不喜欢“灵”这个词。
And yet, if your definition of that word implies the idea of a personality without a physical body,
然而，如果你对那个词的定义意味着没有物质身体的人格，
Then I would have to agree that the description fits me.
那么我不得不承认，这个描述确实适合我。
I address an unseen audience.
我在向一个看不见的听众讲话。
However, I know that my readers exist.
不过，我知道我的读者是存在的。
And therefore I shall ask each of them now to grant me the same privilege.
因此，我现在请求你们每个人给予我同样的特权。
I write this book through the auspices of a woman of whom I have become quite fond.
我在一位我颇为喜爱女士的协助下写这本书。
To others, it seems strange that I address her as Rupert.
对其他人来说，我称她为鲁珀特似乎很奇怪。
And him as well.
也称呼他为（同样的名字）。
But the fact is that I have known her in other times and places by other names.
但事实是，我在其他时代与地方以不同的名字认识过她。
She has been both a man and a woman.
她曾既是男人又是女人。
And the entire identity who has lived these separate lives can be designated by the name of Rupert.
那个经历过这些不同生命的整体身份可以被称为鲁珀特。
Names are not important, however.
然而，名字并不重要。
My name is Seth.
我的名字是赛斯。
Names are simply designations.
名字只是称呼而已。
They are symbols, and yet since you must use them, I shall also.
它们是符号，但既然你必须使用它们，我也会使用。
I write this book with the cooperation of Rupert, who speaks the words for me.
我在鲁珀特的配合下写这本书，她（或他）替我口述这些话语。
In this life, Rupert is called Jane.
在这一世，鲁珀特被称为简。
And her husband, Robert Butts, takes down the words that Jane speaks.
她的丈夫罗伯特·巴茨记录下简所说的话。
I call him Joseph.
我称他为约瑟夫。
My readers may suppose that they are physical creatures bound within physical bodies, imprisoned within bone, flesh and skin.
我的读者可能以为他们是被囚禁在骨肉皮肤内的物质生物。
If you believe that your existence is dependent upon this corporeal image, then you feel in danger of extinction, for no physical form lasts.
如果你相信你的存在依赖于这种肉体形象，那么你会感到濒临灭绝，因为没有任何物质形体是永恒的。
And nobody, however beautiful in youth, retains the same vigor and enchantment in old age.
即便青春再美，也难以在衰老时保持同样的活力与魅力。
If you identify with your own youth or beauty or intellect or accomplishments, then there is the constant gnawing knowledge that these attributes can and will vanish.
如果你认同自己的青春、美貌、智慧或成就，那么你就会不断意识到这些特质可能并终将消失。
I am writing this book to assure you that this is not the case.
我写这本书是为了向你们保证事实并非如此。
Basically, you are no more of a physical being than I am.
基本上，你并不比我更是纯粹的物质存在。
I have donned and discarded more bodies than I care to tell.
我穿戴并舍弃的身体比我愿意细说的要多。
Personalities who do not exist do not write books.
不存在的人格不会写书。
I am quite independent of a physical image, and so are you.
我并不依赖于物质形象，你也一样。
Consciousness creates form; it is not the other way around.
意识创造形式；事实并非相反。
All personalities are not physical.
并非所有的人格都是物质性的。
It is only because you are so busily concerned with daily matters that you do not realize that there is a portion of you who knows that its own powers are far superior to those shown by the ordinary self.
只是因为你忙于日常事务，才没有意识到你有一部分知道其能力远胜于日常自我所表现的那部分。
You have each lived other existences, and that knowledge is within you even if you are not consciously aware of it.
你们每个人都曾经历其他存在状态，这种知识存在于你内心，尽管你未必有意识到。
I hope that this book will serve to release the deeply intuitive self within each of my readers and to bring to the foreground of consciousness whatever particular insights will serve you most.
我希望这本书能唤醒每位读者内在深处的直觉自我，并将那些对你最有用的见解带到意识的前台。
As I begin this book, it is late January in your time, 1970.
当我开始写这本书时，你们的时间是1970年一月下旬。
Rupert is a slim, dark‑haired, quick woman now who sits in a rocker and speaks these words for me; my consciousness is fairly well focused within Rupert's body.
鲁珀特现在是个身材苗条、黑发敏捷的女性，她坐在摇椅上为我口述这些话；我的意识相当集中在鲁珀特的身体中。
It is a cold night.
这是一个寒冷的夜晚。
This is our first experience in writing a complete book in trance, and Rupert was somewhat nervous before the session began.
这是我们第一次在恍惚状态下写整本书，会议开始前鲁珀特有些紧张。
It's not just a simple matter of having this woman speak for me; there are many manipulations necessary and psychological adjustments.
这并不仅仅是让这位女士为我说话那么简单；需要许多操作和心理调整。
We have established what I refer to as a psychological bridge between us — that is, between Rupert and myself.
我们建立了我称之为心理桥梁的联结——即鲁珀特与我之间的连接。
I do not speak through Robert as one might through a telephone; instead, there is a psychological extension, a projection of characteristics on both of our parts, and this I use for our communications.
我并不像通过电话那样通过罗伯特发声；而是有一种心理延伸，是我们双方特征的投射，我用它来进行交流。
Later I will explain how the psychological framework is created and maintained, for it is like a road that must be kept clear of debris.
稍后我将解释心理框架如何被创建与维持；它就像一条必须清除障碍的道路。
You would be much better off in reading this book if you asked yourself who you are rather than ask who I am, for you cannot understand what I am unless you understand the nature of personality and the characteristics of consciousness.
如果你在读这本书时先问自己是谁而不是先问我是谁，会更有收获；因为如果你不了解人格的本质与意识的特性，就无法理解我。
If you believe firmly that your consciousness is locked up somewhere inside your skull and is powerless to escape it, or if you feel that your consciousness ends at the boundary of your body, then you sell yourself short and you will think that I am a delusion.
如果你坚信意识被锁在头骨内部、无法逃脱，或认为意识止于身体边界，那么你就在低估自己，你会认为我只是一种错觉。
I am no more a delusion than you are, and I can say this to each of my readers honestly.
我并不比你更像一场幻觉——我可以诚实地对每位读者这样说。
I am older than you are, at least in terms of the age as you think of it; if a writer can qualify as any kind of authority on the basis of age, then I should get a medal.
我比你年长，至少在你所理解的年龄意义上是如此；如果作家的权威可以以年龄来衡量，那么我应该得到一枚奖章。
I am an energy‑personality essence, no longer focused in physical matter, and as such I am aware of some truths that many of you seem to have forgotten; I hope to remind you of these.
我是一种能量人格的本质，不再局限于物质，因此我意识到许多人似乎已经忘记的一些真理；我希望提醒你们这些真理。
I do not speak so much to the part of you that thinks of yourself as the part that watches television, cooks or works, but to that part of you that you do not know — that which you have to some extent denied and to some extent forgotten.
我不是主要对那部分把自己看作看电视、做饭或工作的自我说话，而是对你未知的那部分说话——那部分你在某种程度上否认并在某种程度上遗忘的自我。
That part of you reads this book even as Hugh read it.
当休读这本书时，你的那部分也在阅读它。
I speak to those who believe in a God and to those who do not, to those who believe that science will find all the answers as to the nature of reality and to those who do not.
我对信仰上帝者与不信者说话，也对那些相信科学会找到现实本质所有答案的人以及不相信的人说话。
I hope to give you clues that will enable you to study the nature of reality for yourself as you have never studied it before.
我希望给你线索，使你能够以前所未有的方式去研究现实的本质。
There are several things that I shall ask you to understand: you are not stuck in time like a family in a closed bottle whose wings are thereby useless.
我希望你理解几件事：你并不被困在时间里，像一个被关在瓶中的家庭一样，因而失去了翅膀。
You cannot trust your physical senses to give you a true picture of reality; they are lovely liars and tell such a fantastic tale that you believe it without question.
你不能相信你的物理感官能给你呈现真实的现实图景；它们是可爱的骗子，编织出奇妙的故事让你毫无疑问地信以为真。
He was sometimes wiser, more creative, and far more knowledgeable when you are dreaming than when you were awake.
在你做梦时，他有时比清醒时更智慧、更有创造力且更有学识。
These statements may seem highly dubious to you now, but when we are finished, I hope that you will see that they are plain statements of fact.
这些说法现在对你可能看起来十分可疑，但当我们讲述完时，我希望你会发现它们只是简单的事实陈述。
What I will tell you has been told throughout the centuries and given again when it was forgotten; I hope to clarify many points that have been distorted through the years, and to offer my original interpretation of others, for no knowledge exists in a vacuum and all information must be interpreted and colored by the personality who holds it and passes it on.
我要讲述的内容在几个世纪以来不断被传述，并在被遗忘时再次传授；我希望澄清多年来被歪曲的许多观点，并对其他观点给出我原始的解释，因为没有知识存在于真空之中，所有信息都必须由持有并传递它的人格来解释和着色。
Therefore, I describe reality as I know it and my experience in many layers and dimensions; this is not to say that other realities do not exist — I have been conscious before your earth was formed.
因此，我按所知描述现实以及我在许多层面与维度的经验；这并不是说其他现实不存在——在你们的地球形成之前我就已具备意识。
To write this book and most of my communications with Rupert I adopt from my own bank of past personalities those characteristics that seem appropriate.
为写这本书以及大部分与鲁珀特的交流，我从自己过去人格的储备中采用那些看似合适的特质。
There are many of us — personalities like myself, unfocused in physical matter or time.
我们之中有许多人——像我这样的个体并不局限于物质或时间。
Our existence seems strange to you only because you do not realize the true potentials of personality and you are hypnotized by your own limited concepts.
我们的存在对你来说显得奇怪，仅仅因为你没有意识到人格的真正潜能，并被你自己有限的观念所催眠。
I am primarily a teacher, though I have not been a man of letters per se; I am primarily a personality with a message.
我主要是一名教师，尽管我并非传统意义上的文人；我本质上是一个携带信息的人格。
You create the world that you know of; you have been given perhaps the most awesome gift of all — the ability to project your thoughts outward in a physical form.
你创造了你所认知的世界；你们被赋予了或许是最了不起的礼物——将思想向外投射为物质形式的能力。
The gift brings a responsibility, and many of you are tempted to congratulate yourselves on the successes of your lives and to blame God, fate, and society for your failures.
这份礼物带来了责任，许多人往往为自己生活的成功自鸣得意，并将失败归咎于上帝、命运与社会。
And like matter, mankind has a tendency to project his own guilt and his own errors upon a Father‑God image, who, it seems, must grow weary of so many complaints.
与物质一样，人类倾向于将自身的罪疚与错误投射到父神形象之上，而那形象似乎必然厌倦如此多的抱怨。
The fact is that each of you create your own physical reality, and en masse you create both the glories and the terrors that exist within your earthly experience.
事实是，你们每个人都创造了自己的物质现实；集体而言，你们创造了尘世体验中的荣耀与恐惧。
Until you realize that you are the creators you will refuse to accept this responsibility, nor can you blame a devil for the world's misfortunes; you have grown sophisticated enough to realize that the devil is a projection of your own psyche, but you have not grown wise enough to learn how to use your creativity constructively.
在你意识到自己是创造者之前，你会拒绝承担责任，也无法将世界的不幸归咎于魔鬼；你已经足够成熟，能认识到魔鬼是你心灵的投射，但尚未足够聪明以建设性地运用自己的创造力。
Most of my readers are familiar with the term "muscle bound"; as a species you have grown ego‑bound instead, held in spiritual rigidity, with the intuitive portions of the self either denied or distorted beyond recognition.
我的大多数读者熟悉“肌肉束缚”一词；作为一个物种，你们反而变得自我束缚，陷于精神僵化，直觉部分要么被否认要么被扭曲得面目全非。
The hour is growing late; both of my friends must get up early in the morning.
时间已晚；我的两个朋友都得一早起床。
Rupert is working on two books of his own and must get his sleep.
鲁珀特有两本自己的书要写，必须休息好。
Before I end this session, I ask you to imagine our setting, for Rupert has told me that a writer must be careful to set the scene.
在我结束本节之前，请你想象我们的场景；鲁珀特告诉我，作家必须小心地布置场景。
I speak through Rupert twice a week on Mondays and Wednesdays in the same large living room; the lights are always lit.
我每周通过鲁珀特口述两次，在每周一和周三的同一间大客厅内；灯总是亮着。
This evening it is enjoyable for me to look out through Rupert's eyes at the wintry corner and beyond; physical reality has always been refreshing to me, and through Rupert's cooperation as I write this book I see that I was correct in appreciating its unique charms.
今晚，我很高兴能透过鲁珀特的眼睛眺望冬日的角落及更远之处；物质现实总让我耳目一新，通过鲁珀特的配合写这本书，我发现自己对它独特魅力的欣赏是正确的。
There is one other character to be mentioned here — Willie the Cat, a beloved monster who was now sleeping.
这里还要提到另一个角色——心爱的怪物猫威利，此刻正在睡觉。
The nature of animal consciousness in itself is a highly interesting subject, and one that we will later consider.
动物意识的本质本身是一个非常有趣的课题，稍后我们会讨论。
The cat is aware of my presence and has on several occasions reacted rather noticeably to it.
这只猫能意识到我的存在，且在几次情况下对其产生了明显反应。
In this book I hope to show the constant interactions that occur between all units of consciousness — the communication that leaps beyond the barriers of species — and in some of these discussions we will use Willie as a case in point.
在本书中，我希望展示发生在各个意识单元之间的持续互动——跨越物种障碍的交流——在一些讨论中我们将以威利为例。
Since we have mentioned animals, let me say here that they do possess a kind of consciousness that does not allow them as many freedoms as your own, yet at the same time they are not handicapped in their use by certain characteristics that often impede the practical potential of human consciousness.
既然提到了动物，我在此说明它们确实拥有一种意识，这种意识不赋予它们像你们那样多的自由；但与此同时，它们也没有某些常常妨碍人类意识实际潜能的缺陷。
Consciousness is a way of perceiving the various dimensions of reality; consciousness as you know it is highly specialized and the physical senses allow you to perceive the three‑dimensional world, and yet by their very nature they can inhibit the perception of other equally valid dimensions.
意识是一种感知现实各维度的方式；你所知的意识高度专业化，物理感官使你能够感知三维世界，但它们的本性也会抑制对其他同样有效维度的感知。
Most of you identify with your daily physically oriented self, and you would not think of identifying with one portion of your body and ignoring all other parts.
你们大多数人认同的是日常以身体为导向的自我，你不会想着认同身体的一部分而忽视其他部分。
And yet you were doing the same thing when you imagined that the egotistical self carries the burden of your identity.
然而，当你以为自负的自我承载着你身份的全部时，你其实也在做同样的事。
I am telling you that you are not a cosmic bag of bones and flesh thrown together through some mixture of chemicals and elements; I am telling you that your consciousness is not some fiery product formed merely accidentally through the inner workings of chemical components.
我告诉你，你并不是一个由化学元素混合拼凑而成的骨肉袋；你的意识也不是因化学作用偶然形成的产物。
You are not a forsaken offshoot of physical matter, nor is your consciousness meant to vanish like a puff of smoke.
你不是物质的被遗弃分支，你的意识也不是注定像一缕烟那样消失。
Instead, you form the physical body that you know at a deeply unconscious level with great discrimination, miraculous clarity and intimate unconscious knowledge; each minute cell that composes it is not meant symbolically.
相反，你在深层无意识中以极高的分辨力形成你所认知的物质身体，展现出奇迹般的清晰和亲密的无意识知识；组成身体的每一个细胞并非象征意义。
Now, because your conscious mind as you think of it is not aware of these activities, you do not identify with this inner portion of yourselves.
现在，由于你所认为的意识并未意识到这些活动，你并不认同自己内心的这一部分。
You prefer to identify with the part of you who watches television or cooks or works — the part you think knows what it is doing — but this seemingly unconscious portion of yourself is far more knowledgeable, and upon its smooth functioning your entire physical existence depends.
你更愿意认同那个看电视、做饭或工作的人——你认为知道自己在做什么的那一部分——但这看似无意识的部分其实更有智慧，你的整个物质存在依赖于它的顺利运作。
This portion is conscious and alert; yet so focused in physical reality, who does not listen to its voice and who does not understand that it is the great psychological strength from which your physically oriented self springs?
这部分是有意识且警觉的；然而它如此专注于物质现实，以致无人倾听它的声音，也无人理解那正是以身体为导向的自我之源的巨大心理力量。
I call this seemingly unconscious inner ego — the deeper identity who forms both the inner ego and the outer ego and who decided that you would be a physical being in this place and in this time.
我称之为看似无意识的内在自我——那个形成内在自我与外在自我并决定你将在此地此时成为物质存在的更深层身份。
This is the core of your identity, the psychic seed from which you sprang — the multi‑dimensional personality of which you are part.
这是你身份的核心，生成你的心灵种子——你所属于的多维人格。
For those of you who wonder where I place the subconscious as psychologists, think of it as a meeting place, so to speak, between the outer and inner egos.
对于那些好奇心理学家把潜意识置于何处的人，可以把它想象成外在自我与内在自我之间的一个会聚之地。
You must understand that there are no real divisions to the self; we speak of various portions only to make the basic idea clear since we are addressing individuals who do identify with the normally conscious self.
你必须明白，自我并无真正分裂；我们之所以谈及不同部分只是为了阐明基本观念，因为我们在与那些确实认同通常意识自我的个人对话。
I bring such matters up in this first chapter because I will be using the terms later in the book and because I want to state the fact of multidimensional personality as soon as possible.
我在第一章提出这些问题，因为我将在本书后续使用这些术语，并且希望尽快陈述多维人格的事实。
You cannot understand yourselves and you cannot accept my independent existence until you rid yourself of the notion that personality is a here‑and‑now attribute of consciousness.
除非你摆脱人格只是此时此地属性的观念，否则你无法理解自己，也无法接受我的独立存在。
Now, some of the things that I may say about physical reality in this book may startle you, but remember that I am viewing it from an entirely different standpoint; you are presently focused entirely within it, wondering perhaps what else, if anything, there may be outside.
现在，我在书中关于物质现实的一些说法可能会使你吃惊，但请记住我是从完全不同的立场观察；你目前完全沉浸其中，或许在想外面是否还有其他事物。
I am outside, returning momentarily to a dimension that I know and love.
我在外面，暂时回到一个我熟悉且喜爱的维度。
I am not, in your terms, a resident, however while I have a psychic passport there are still some problems of translation and inconveniences of entry that I must contend with.
我并非你所理解的居住者，尽管我持有一种通灵般的“护照”，但仍有一些翻译问题与进入的不便需要我应对。
Many people are here who have lived for years in New York City and never taken a tour through the Empire State Building, while many foreigners are well acquainted with it.
许多人在这里，他们在纽约生活多年却从未参观帝国大厦，而许多外国人对此却很熟悉。
And so while you have a physical body I may still be able to point out some very strange and miraculous psychic and psychological structures within your own system of reality that you have ignored.
因此，尽管你有物质身体，我仍能指出你现实系统中一些非常奇特并且奇妙的精神与心理结构，而这些结构常被你忽视。
I hope, quite frankly, to do far more than this — to take you on a tour through the levels of reality that are available to you and to guide you on a journey through the dimensions of your own psychological structure, opening up whole areas of your own consciousness of which you have been relatively unaware.
坦白说，我希望做得比这更多——带你游览可供你进入的现实层面，引导你踏上穿越自身心理结构维度的旅程，开启你相对陌生的意识领域。
I hope therefore not only to explain the multi dimensional aspects personality but to give each reader some glimpse of that greater identity — his own.
因此，我不仅希望解释人格的多维面向，还希望让每位读者得以一瞥那更宏大的身份——他自身。
The self that you know is but one fragment of your entire identity; these fragment selves are not strung together like beads on a string, but are more like the various skins of an onion or segments of an orange, all connected through one vitality and growing out into various realities while springing from the same source.
你所认识的自我只是整个身份的一片碎片；这些碎片并非像串珠般连在一起，而更像洋葱的层皮或橘子的瓣，它们通过同一生命力相连，从同一源头衍生并发展为不同的现实。
This makes our communications possible.
这使我们的沟通成为可能。
I will try to put this as simply as possible: there is within his psyche what amounts to a transparent dimensional warp that serves almost like an open window through which other realities can be perceived — a multidimensional opening that has to some extent escaped being clouded over by the shade of physical focus.
我将尽量简明扼要地说明：在他的心灵中存在一种近乎透明的维度扭曲，几乎像一扇敞开的窗口，通过它可以感知其他现实——这是一种在某种程度上没有被物质焦点的阴影遮蔽的多维开口。
The physical senses usually blind you to these open channels, for they perceive reality only in their own image.
物理感官通常使你对这些开放通道视而不见，因为它们只以自身的形象来感知现实。
To some extent then I enter your reality through a psychological warp in your space and time; in a manner of speaking such an open channel serves much as a pathway between Rupert's personality and my own so that communication is possible between us.
在某种程度上，我通过你时空中的心理扭曲进入你的现实；可以说，这样一个开放通道在很大程度上充当了鲁珀特与我之间的路径，使我们之间的交流成为可能。
Such psychological and psychic warps between dimensions of existence are not infrequent, though they are merely recognized as such infrequently and utilized even less so.
存在维度之间的这类心理与精神扭曲并不罕见，只是很少被识别并更少被利用。
I will try to give you some idea of my own non‑physical existence; let it serve to remind you that your own basic identity is non‑physical, as my own.
我会尽力让你了解我自己的非物质存在；愿它提醒你，你自身的基本身份也是非物质的，正如我一样。
This is the end of chapter 1.
这是第一章的结尾。
