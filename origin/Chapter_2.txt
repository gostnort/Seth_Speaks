Chapter 2: My present environment, Work, and activities.
第二章: 我现在所处的环境、工作和活动。
While my environment differs in rather important respects from that of my readers, I can assure you, with ironic understatement, that it is as vivid, varied, and vital as physical existence.
虽然我所处的环境在相当重要的方面不同于我的读者，但我可以用反讽的轻描淡写向你保证，它和物质存在一样生动、多样且充满活力。
It is more pleasurable.
这更令人愉快。
Though my ideas of pleasure have changed since I was a physical being.
虽然我对快乐的看法已经改变了，因为我是一个肉体的存在。
Being more rewarding and offering far greater opportunities for creative achievement.
获得更多的回报，并提供更多创造性成就的机会。
My present existence is the most challenging one that I have known, and I have known many, both physical and non-physical.
我现在的存在是我所经历过的最具挑战性的，我经历过许多不同的存在，无论是物质还是非物质的。
There is not just one dimension in which non physical consciousness resides.
非物质意识并不只存在一个维度。
Any more than there is only one country on your planet.
就像地球上只有一个国家一样。
Or planet within your solar system.
或者是太阳系内的行星。
My environment now.
我现在所处的环境。
Is not the one in which you will find yourselves immediately after death.
并不是你们死后马上就会发现自己身处其中的那种。
I cannot help speaking humorously.
我忍不住幽默地说了起来。
But you must die many times before you enter this particular plane of existence.
但是在你进入这个特殊的存在层面之前，你必须死很多次。
Birth is much more of a shock than death.
出生比死亡更让人震惊。
Sometimes when you die, you do not realize it.
有时候，当你死去时，你并没有意识到这一点。
But birth almost always implies a sharp and sudden recognition.
但出生几乎总是意味着一种敏锐而突然的认知。
So there is no need to fear death.
所以，我们没有必要害怕死亡。
And I, who have died more times than I care to tell, write this book to tell you so.
我已经死过很多次，次数多得不愿多说；我写这本书就是要告诉你这一点。
My work in this environment provides far more challenge than any of.
我在这种环境下的工作带来的挑战远远超过任何一个人。
You know.
你懂的。
And it also necessitates the manipulation of creative materials that are nearly beyond your present comprehension.
这也需要对你现在几乎无法理解的创造性材料进行处理。
I will say more of this shortly.
稍后我将详细介绍这方面的情况。
First of all.
首先。
You must understand that no objective reality exists but that which is created by consciousness.
你必须明白，除了由意识创造的东西之外，没有客观现实存在。
Consciousness always creates form.
意识总是创造形式。
And not the other way around.
而不是相反。
So my environment is a reality of existence created by myself and others like me.
所以我的环境是由我自己和其他像我一样的人创造的现实存在。
And it represents the manifestation of our development.
它代表了我们发展的表现。
We do not use permanent structures.
我们不使用永久性建筑。
There is not a city or a town, for example, in which I dwell.
例如，没有一个城市或城镇是我所居住的。
I do not mean to imply that we are often empty space.
我的意思并不是说我们经常是一片空白。
For one thing, we do not think of space as you do.
首先，我们不像你们那样看待太空。
And we form whatever particular images we want to surround us.
我们会形成任何我们想要围绕在我们周围的特定图像。
They are created by our mental patterns.
它们是由我们的思维模式创造出来的。
Just as your own physical reality is created in perfect replica of your inner desires and thoughts.
就像你自己的物质现实是在你内心欲望和想法的完美复制品中创造出来的。
You think that objects exist independently of you.
你认为物体独立于你而存在。
Not realizing that they are instead the manifestations of your own psychological and psychic selves.
没有意识到它们反而是你自己心理和精神自我的表现。
We realized that we form our own reality.
我们意识到我们形成了自己的现实。
And therefore we do so with considerable joy and creative abandoned.
因此，我们满怀喜悦并以创造性的投入来做这件事。
In my environment you would be highly disoriented, for it would seem to you as if it lacked coherency.
在我的环境中，你会感到非常迷失，因为在你看来它似乎缺乏连贯性。
We are aware of the inner laws that govern all materializations.
我们意识到支配一切物质化的内在法则。
However.
然而。
I can have it night or day in your terms as I prefer.
无论白天黑夜，我都可以用你的方式来做。
Or any period, say of your history.
或者任何时期，比如你的历史。
These changing forms would in no way bother my associates.
这些不断变化的形式丝毫不会困扰我的同事。
For they would take them as immediate clues as to my mood.
因为他们会把它们当作我心情的直接线索。
Feelings and ideas.
感受和想法。
Permanency and stability basically have nothing to do with form.
永久性和稳定性基本上与形式无关。
But with the integration of pleasure.
而是与快乐的融合。
Purpose, accomplishment, and identity.
目标、成就和身份。
I travel to many other levels of existence in order to fulfill my duties, which are primarily those of a teacher and educator, and I use whatever aids and techniques serve me best within those systems.
为了履行职责，我穿越许多存在层面，主要是以教师和教育者的身份，并在这些体系中使用对我最有帮助的辅助工具和技术。
In other words.
换句话说。
I may teach the same lesson in many different ways.
我可以用许多不同的方式来教授同样的课程。
According to the abilities and assumptions that are inherent in any given system in which I must operate.
根据我必须在其中运作的任何给定系统中固有的能力和假设。
I use one portion of myself for many personalities that are available to my identity in these communications and in this book; in other systems of reality, the particular set of personality that I, in my larger identity, adopt here would not be understood.
在这些交流和这本书中，我使用自身的一部分来表现多种人格；在其他现实系统中，我以更大身份在此采用的这种特定人格可能无法被理解。
All systems of reality are not physically oriented, you see.
你看，所有的现实系统都不是物理导向的。
And some are entirely unacquainted with visible form.
有些人完全不了解可见的形式。
Nor is sex, as you understand it, natural to them.
正如你所理解的那样，性对他们来说也不是自然的。
Therefore, I would not communicate as a male personality who has lived many physical existences.
因此，我不会以一个经历过许多物质存在的男性人格来交流。
Though this is a legitimate and valid portion of my identity.
虽然这是我身份的合法和有效部分。
In my home environment I assume whatever shape I please and it may vary and does with the nature of my thoughts.
在我的家庭环境中，我喜欢什么样的形状就做什么样的形状，它可能会随着我思想的性质而变化。
You, however, form your own physical image at an unconscious level in more or less the same manner.
然而，你在无意识的层面上以大致相同的方式形成了自己的物理形象。
But with some important differences.
但有一些重要的区别。
You usually do not realize that your physical body is created by you at each moment as a direct result of your inner conception of what you are.
你通常没有意识到，你的身体每时每刻都是由你创造出来的，这是你内心对自己的概念的直接结果。
Or that it changes in important chemical and electromagnetic ways?
或者它以重要的化学和电磁方式发生变化？
With the ever moving pace of your own thought.
随着你自己思想的不断变化。
Having long ago recognized the dependence of form upon consciousness.
很久以前就认识到形式对意识的依赖性。
We have simply been able to change our forms entirely.
我们只是能够完全改变我们的形式。
So that they more faithfully follow each nuance of our inner experience.
让它们更忠实地遵循我们内心体验的每一个细微差别。
Now, this ability to change form is an inherent characteristic of any consciousness.
现在，这种改变形态的能力是任何意识的固有特征。
Only the degree of proficiency and actualization varies.
只是熟练程度和实现程度不同。
You can see this in your own system.
你可以在自己的系统中看到这一点。
In a slowed down version when you observe that changing forms taken by living matter through its evolutionary history.
当你观察到有生命的物质在其进化史中所采取的变化形态时，你会以一种放慢的方式看到这一点。
Now we can also take several forms at one time, so to speak.
可以说，现在我们也可以同时采取几种形式。
But you can also do this, although you do not generally realize it.
但你也可以这样做，尽管你通常并没有意识到这一点。
Your physical form can lie sleeping and inert upon the bed.
你的身体可以躺在床上睡觉，也可以躺在床上毫无知觉。
While your consciousness travels in a dream form it may become quite dispersed simultaneously.
当你的意识以梦的形式旅行时，它可能会同时变得相当分散。
Simultaneously.
同时。
You may create a thought form of yourself.
你可能会创造出自己的思维形态。
Identical in every respect.
各方面都一样。
And this may appear in the room of a friend quite without your conscious awareness.
这可能会在你毫无意识的情况下出现在朋友的房间里。
So consciousness as to the forms it can create at any given time.
关于意识在任何特定时间可以创造的形式。
Practically speaking.
实事求是地说。
We are rather more advanced along these lines than you.
在这方面，我们比你们先进得多。
And when we create such forms we do so with complete awareness.
而当我们创造这样的形式时，我们是完全有意识地这样做的。
I share my field of existence with others who have more or less the same challenges to meet.
我与其他或多或少面临相同挑战的人分享我的生存领域。
And so the same overall pattern of development.
所以发展的总体格局是一样的。
Some I have known and others I have not.
有的我认识，有的我不认识。
We communicate telepathically, but then again telepathy is the basis of your languages, without which their symbolism would be meaningless, because we do communicate in this manner.
我们通过心灵感应交流；话说回来，心灵感应是你们语言的基础，没有它们的象征意义就毫无意义，因为我们确实以这种方式交流。
This does not necessarily mean that we use mental words.
这并不一定意味着我们使用心理语言。
We communicate instead through what I can only call thermal and electromagnetic images that are capable of supporting much more meaning in one sequence.
相反，我们通过我只能称之为热图像和电磁图像的方式进行交流，这些图像能在一个序列中承载更多意义。
The intensity of the communication is dependent upon the emotional intensity behind it, although the phrase "emotional intensity" may be misleading.
沟通的强度取决于其背后的情感强度，尽管“情感强度”一词可能具有误导性。
We do feel an equivalent of what you call emotions, but these are not the love-for-hate or anger that you know.
我们确实感受到与你所说的情绪相当的东西，但这些并不是你所知道的爱恨或愤怒。
Your feelings can best be described as three-dimensional materializations — far greater psychological events and experiences that are related to the inner senses.
你的感受可以被描述为三维的具象化——与内在感官相关的更为宏大的心理事件和体验。
I will explain these inner senses to you later, at the end of this chapter.
我将在本章末尾向你解释这些内在感官。
Suffice it here to say that we have strong emotional experience, although it differs in a large measure from your own; it is far less limited and far more expansive, and we are also aware of and responsive to the emotional climate as a whole.
在此只需说明我们有强烈的情感体验，尽管在很大程度上它与你们的不同；它的局限性要小得多，范围更广，我们也意识到并对整体情绪氛围做出反应。
We are much freer to feel and experience because we are not as afraid of being swept away by strong emotions: our identities do not feel threatened, for example, by the strong emotions of another.
我们在感受与体验方面更为自由，因为我们不太害怕被强烈情绪所吞没；例如，我们的身份不会因他人的强烈情绪而感到受到威胁。
We are able to travel through emotions in a way that is not now natural to you, and to translate them into other facets of creativity than those with which you are familiar.
我们能够以一种你现在并不自然的方式穿越情感，并将其转化为不同于你所熟悉的创造力方面。
We do not feel the need to conceal emotions, for we know it is basically impossible and undesirable within your system (they can appear troublesome because you have not yet learned how to use them).
我们不觉得有必要隐藏情绪，因为我们知道在你的体系中这基本上既不可能也不可取（它们可能显得麻烦，因为你尚未学会如何使用它们）。
We are only now learning their full potential and the powers of creativity with which they are connected.
我们现在才开始了解它们的全部潜力以及与之相关的创造力。
Now, since we realized that our identity is not dependent upon form, therefore, of course, we do not fear changing it, knowing that we can adopt any form we desire.
现在，我们意识到我们的身份并不依赖于形式，因此我们当然不害怕改变形式，并知道我们可以采用任何想要的形式。
We do not know death in your terms.
我们不能用你的眼光来理解死亡。
Our existence takes us into many other environments, and we blend into these, following whatever rules of form exist within these environments.
我们的存在将我们带入许多其他环境，并与之融合，遵循这些环境中存在的形式规则。
All of us here are teachers and we therefore adapt our methods also so that they will make sense to personalities with varying ideas of reality.
在座的各位都是教师，因此我们也调整方法，以便使其对具有不同现实观念的人有意义。
Consciousness is not dependent upon form, as I have said, and yet it always seeks to create form.
正如我所说，意识不依赖于形式，但它总是寻求创造形式。
We do not exist in any time framework as you know it; minutes, hours or years have lost both their meaning and their fascination.
我们并不存在于你所知道的任何时间框架中；几分钟、几小时或几年都失去了意义和吸引力。
We are quite aware of the time situation within other systems, however, and we must take them into account in our communications; otherwise, what we say would not be understood.
然而，我们非常清楚其他系统中的时间状况，并且在沟通中必须考虑这些因素，否则我们所说的话就不会被理解。
There are no real barriers to separate the systems of which I speak; the only separation is brought about by the varying abilities of personalities to perceive and manipulate.
我所说的系统之间并没有真正的障碍；唯一的分离是由不同个体感知和操纵能力的差异造成的。
You exist in the midst of many other systems of reality, for example, but you do not perceive them.
例如，你就存在于许多其他现实系统之中，但你并未感知到它们。
And even when some event intrudes from these systems into your own three-dimensional existence, you are not able to interpret it, for it is assorted by the very fact of entry.
即使某些事件从这些系统侵入你自己的三维存在，你也无法解释它，因为入口本身就会对其加以分类。
I told you that we do not experience your time sequence; we travel through various intense cities of work, development, and experience, all taking place within what I term the moment point.
我告诉过你，我们不会经历你的时间序列；我们穿越各种强烈的工作、发展与体验的城市，这一切都发生在我所称的“时刻点”之内。
Here within the moment point the smallest thought is brought to fruition, the slightest possibility explored, probabilities thoroughly examined, whether the least or the most forceful feeling is entertained.
在时刻点内，最微小的想法得以实现，最细微的可能性被探索，概率被彻底审查，无论是最微弱还是最强烈的感受都会被考虑。
It is difficult to explain this clearly, and yet the moment point is the framework within which we have our psychological experience; within it simultaneous actions follow freely through associative patterns.
这很难解释清楚，然而时刻点是我们心理体验的框架；在其中，同时的行动通过联想模式自由进行。
For example, pretend that I think of you, Joseph; in so doing I immediately experience, and fully, your past, present and future in your terms, and all of those strong or determining emotions and motivations that have ruled you.
例如，假设我想到你，约瑟夫；在这样做时，我立即并完全体验到你所说的过去、现在和未来，以及那些支配你的强烈或决定性情绪与动机。
I can travel through those experiences with you if I choose; we can follow a consciousness through all of its forms, and in your terms, within the flicker of an eye.
如果我愿意，我可以与你一同穿越这些经历；例如，我们可以追随一个意识经由其所有形式，并在你的时间观念中在一眨眼之间完成。
Now it takes study, development and experience before an identity can learn to hold its own stability in the face of such constant stimuli.
现在需要通过学习、发展和经验，身份才能学会在这种持续不断的刺激面前保持自身稳定。
Many of us have gotten lost, even forgetting who we were until we once more awakened to ourselves; much of this is quite automatic to us now.
我们中的许多人曾迷失过，甚至忘记了自己是谁，直到我们再次觉醒；现在这些过程对我们来说在很大程度上是自动的。
And the infinite varieties of consciousness — we are still aware of a small percentage of the entire banks of personalities that exist; for our vacations we visit quite simple life forms and blend with them.
以及无穷无尽的意识——我们仍意识到存在的人格库中的一小部分；作为我们的“假期”，我们会探访相当简单的生命形式并与之融合。
To this extent we indulge in relaxation and sleep, for we can spend a century as a tree or as an uncomplicated life form in another reality; we delight our consciousness with the enjoyment of simple existence.
在这方面我们沉浸于放松与睡眠；因为我们可以在另一个现实中作为一棵树或一种简单的生命形式度过一个世纪，我们因此以简单存在的享受来愉悦我们的意识。
We may create, you see, the forest in which we grow.
我们可以创造——你看，这是我们生长的森林。
Usually, however, we are highly active, our full energies focused in our work and in new challenges.
然而通常我们都非常活跃，全部精力投入到工作和新的挑战中。
We can form from ourselves, from our own psychological entireties, other personalities whenever we wish; these, however, must then develop according to their own merit, using the creative abilities inherent in them, and then they are free to go their own way.
只要我们愿意，我们可以从自我、从自身的心理整体中形成其他人格；但这些人格必须按其自身优点发展，运用其固有的创造能力，然后才能自由地走自己的路。
We have not done this lately, however.
然而，我们最近并没有这么做。
Each reader, therefore, is a portion of his or her own entity and is developing toward the same kind of existence that I know.
因此，每位读者都是其自身实体的一部分，正在朝着我所了解的那种存在发展。
In childhood and in the dream state each personality is aware to some extent of the true freedom that belongs to its own inner consciousness.
在童年和梦境中，每个人格在某种程度上意识到属于其内在意识的真正自由。
These abilities of which I speak are our inherent characteristics of consciousness as a whole and of each personality.
我所说的这些能力是整体意识以及每个人格的固有特征。
My environment, as I told you, changes constantly, and so does your own; you rationalize away quite legitimate intuitive perception at such times.
正如我告诉你的，我的环境一直在变化，你的环境也一样；在这种时候你会把相当合理的直觉合理化掉。
For example, if a room suddenly appears small and cramped to you, you take it for granted that this change of dimension is imaginative and that the room has not changed, regardless of your feelings.
例如，如果一个房间突然在你看来显得狭小拥挤，你就会理所当然地认为这种尺寸的变化是想象出来的，并且房间并没有变化，不论你的感觉如何。
The fact is that the room under such conditions will have changed quite definitely and in very major respects, even though the physical dimensions will still measure the same; the entire psychological impact of the room will have altered, and its effect will be felt by others besides yourself.
事实是，在这种情况下，房间肯定会发生非常重大的变化，尽管物理尺寸仍然相同；整个房间对心理的影响会改变，其效果也会被他人感受到。
It will attract certain kinds of events rather than others, and it will alter your own psychological structure and hormonal output; it will react to the altered state of the room, even in quite physical ways.
它将吸引某些类型的事件，而不是其他的，并会改变你自己的心理结构和荷尔蒙分泌；即使以相当物理的方式，它也会对房间的改变产生反应。
Though its width and length may not seem to vary, and inches her feet may not seem to vary.
虽然它的宽度和长度看起来可能没有变化，几寸的差别也似乎不明显。
I told her good friend Joseph to underline the word "seeing," because your instruments would show no physical alteration, since the instruments within such a room themselves have already altered to the same degree.
我曾告诉她的好友约瑟夫在“看见”这个词下划线，因为你的仪器不会显示任何物理变化；这是因为这样的房间中的仪器自身已发生了同等程度的改变。
You are constantly changing the form, the shape and the meaning of your physical body and most intimate environment, although you do your best to ignore these constant alterations.
你在不断改变形式、形状以及身体和最亲密环境的意义，尽管你尽力忽视这些持续的变化。
On the other hand, we allow them full rein, knowing that we are motivated by an inner stability that can well afford spontaneity and creation, and realizing that spiritual and psychological identity are dependent upon creative change.
另一方面，我们给予它们充分的自由，因为我们知道我们的动力来自内在的稳定性，这种稳定性完全可以容纳自发性与创造力，并意识到精神与心理身份依赖于创造性的变化。
Our environment, therefore, is composed of exquisite imbalances where change is allowed full play.
因此，我们的环境由微妙的不平衡组成，在那里变革可以充分发挥作用。
Your own time structure misleads you into ideas of the relative permanency of physical matter, and you close your eyes to the constant alterations within it.
你自己的时间结构使你误以为物质具有相对永久性，并使你对其中的持续变化视而不见。
Your physical senses confine you as best they can to the perceptions of a highly formalized reality; only through the use of the intuitions and in sleep and dream states as a rule can you perceive that joyfully changing nature of your own and any consciousness.
你的物理感官尽可能地将你限制在高度形式化现实的感知中；通常只有通过直觉以及在睡眠与梦境状态中，你才能察觉到自身与任何意识那种愉悦的变化本性。
One of my duties is to enlighten you on such matters; we must use concepts that are at least fairly familiar to you, and in doing so we therefore use portions of our own personalities with whom you can to some extent relate.
我的职责之一是就此启发你；我们必须使用至少对你相当熟悉的概念，在这样做时我们使用了自己性格的一部分，你在某种程度上可以与之关联。
There is no end to our environment in your terms; there would be no lack of space or time in which to operate, and how this would put tremendous pressure on any consciousness without proper background and development.
用你的术语来说，我们的环境是无穷无尽的；不会缺少可操作的空间或时间，但这会给任何没有适当背景与发展支持的意识带来巨大压力。
We do not have one simple cosy universe in which to hide; we are still alert to other, quite alien systems of reality that flash on the very outskirts of consciousness as we know it.
我们没有一个可以躲藏的简单舒适的宇宙；我们仍然警惕着在我们所知的意识边缘闪现的其他相当陌生的现实系统。
There are far more various kinds of consciousness, and there are physical forms, each with its own patterns of perception, dwelling within its own camouflage system.
存在更多不同类型的意识，也存在物质形式；每一种都有其自身的感知模式，栖居在自身的伪装系统中。
Yet all of these have inner knowledge of the reality that exists within all camouflage and that comprises any reality, by whatever name it is called.
然而，所有这些存在都对存在于一切伪装之内并构成任何现实的本质有内在认知，无论它被何种名称所称呼。
Now, many of these freedoms are quite natural to you in the dream, and you form dream environments often to exercise such potentials.
现在，在梦中这些许多自由对你来说很自然，你经常创造梦境环境来锻炼这些潜能。
Later I will have at least some remarks to make concerning the ways that you can learn to recognize your own feats and to compare them with your proficiency in daily physical life.
稍后我将至少谈及一些你如何学会识别自己成就的方法，并将它们与你在日常物质生活中的熟练程度进行比较。
You can learn to change your physical environment, therefore, by learning to change and manipulate your dream environment.
因此，通过学习改变与操纵你的梦境环境，你可以学会改变物质环境。
You can also suggest specific dreams in which a desired change is seen, and under certain conditions these will then appear in your physical reality.
你也可以建议具体的梦境，在这些梦中看到想要的变化，并且在特定条件下这些变化会出现在你的物质现实中。
Now, often you do this without realizing it.
现在，你经常在没有意识到的情况下这样做。
Whole consciousness adopts various forms; it need not always be within a form, and all forms are not physical ones.
整体意识采用各种形式；它不必总是处于某种形态之中，而所有形式并非都是物理的。
Some personalities, therefore, have never been physical; they've evolved along different lines and their psychological structures would be alien to you.
因此，有些人格从未是物质的；它们沿着不同的路径进化，其心理结构对你而言可能是陌生的。
To some extent, I also travel through such environments.
在某种程度上，我也穿越这些环境。
Consciousness must show itself; however, it cannot unbe — it is not physical and must therefore show its activation in other ways.
意识必须显现自身；然而，它不能消失——它并非物质，因此必须以其他方式显现其活跃。
In some systems, for example, it forms highly integrated mathematical and musical patterns that are themselves stimuli for other universal systems.
例如，在某些系统中，它形成高度整合的数学与音乐模式，这些模式本身就是对其他宇宙系统的刺激。
I am not very well acquainted with these, however, and cannot speak of them with any great familiarity.
然而，我对此并不十分熟悉，无法详尽描述。
If my environment is not a permanently structured one, and as I have told you, neither is your own.
如果我的环境不是一个永久结构化的实体，正如我所说，你的环境也不是。
If I am aware of communicating now through Rupert, in different ways each of you telepathically communicate to and through other personalities, though with little knowledge of your accomplishments.
如果我知道我现在正通过鲁伯特进行交流，你们每个人也以不同方式通过心灵感应与其他人格交流，只是对自己的成就知之甚少。
Sensors that you use in a very real manner create the environment that you perceive; your physical senses necessitate the perception of the three-dimensional reality.
你以一种非常真实的方式使用的感知器创造了你所感知的环境；你的物理感官使你必须感知三维现实。
Consciousness is equipped with inner perceptors, however; these are inherent within all consciousness, regardless of its development.
然而，意识配备了内在的感知器；这些感知器存在于所有意识之中，无论其发展程度如何。
These preceptors operate quite independently from those that might be assumed when a given consciousness adopts a specialized form, such as a physical body, in order to operate in a particular system.
当某一意识采用特定形式（例如物质身体）以在某个系统中运作时，这些内在感知器的运作与之相当独立。
Each reader, therefore, has inner senses and, to some extent, uses them constantly, though he is not aware of doing so at an egotistical level.
因此，每位读者都有内在感官，并在某种程度上不断使用它们，尽管他并未在自我层面意识到这一点。
Now we use the inner senses quite freely and consciously; if you were to do so, then you would perceive the same kind of environment in which I have my existence.
现在我们相当自由且有意识地使用内在感官；如果你也这样做，你就能感知我所存在的那种环境。
You would see an uncamouflaged situation in which events and form are free and not stuck in a jelly-like mold of time.
你会看到一个没有伪装的情形，其中事件与形式是自由的，不会被时间像果冻一样的模具困住。
You could see, for example, your present living room not only as a conglomeration of permanent-appearing furniture but, if you switch your focus, as the immense and constant dance of molecules and other particles that compose the various objects.
例如，你可以看到你现在的客厅，不仅仅是由看似永久的家具构成，而是如果你转换注意力，还能看见构成各种物体的分子和其他粒子的巨大而持续的舞蹈。
You could see a phosphorescent-like glow — the aura of electromagnetic structures that compose the molecules themselves.
你可以看到类似磷光的光辉——构成分子的电磁结构光环。
You could, if you wished, condense your consciousness until it was small enough to travel through a single molecule, and from the molecule's own world look out and survey the universe of the room in a gigantic galaxy of interrelated, ever-moving starlike shapes.
如果你愿意，你可以把意识凝聚到足以穿过一个分子的程度，并从分子的世界中向外观察，俯瞰房间的宇宙——那是由相互关联、不断移动的类星体组成的巨大星系。
Now all of these possibilities represent a legitimate reality; yours is no more legitimate than any other, but it is the only one that you perceive.
现在，所有这些可能性代表着一种合理的现实；你的现实并不比其他现实更合法，但它是你唯一能感知到的现实。
Using the inner senses we become conscious creators — co-creators, but you are unconscious co-creators whether you know it or not.
通过内在感官，我们成为有意识的创造者——共同创造者；无论你是否知道，你们都是无意识的共同创造者。
For our environment seems unstructured to you, it is only because you do not understand the true nature of order, which has nothing to do with permanent form that only appears to have formed from your perspective.
我们的环境对你似乎无结构，仅仅因为你不了解秩序的真正本质；秩序与永久形式无关，那种形式只是从你的角度看似存在。
There is no 4:00 in the afternoon or 9:00 in the evening in my environment; by this I mean that I am not restricted to a time sequence, though there is nothing preventing me from experiencing such sequences if I choose.
在我的环境中没有下午四点或晚上九点；我的意思是我不受时间序列的限制，尽管如果愿意我仍然可以经历这样的序列。
We experience time, or what you would call its equivalent nature, in terms of intensities of experience — a psychological time with its own peaks and valleys.
我们体验时间，或者你所说的等效性质，是以体验强度来衡量的——一种有高峰与低谷的心理时间。
This is somewhat similar to your own emotional feelings when time seems speeded up or slowed down, but is vastly different in important ways.
这在某种程度上类似于你在情绪起伏时感到时间加速或减慢的体验，但在重要方面又有很大不同。
Our psychological time could be compared, in terms of environment, to the walls of a room; but in our case the walls would be constantly changing in color, size, height, depth and width.
从环境角度来看，我们的心理时间可比作房间的墙壁；但在我们的情况中，墙壁的颜色、大小、高度、深度和宽度会不断变化。
Our psychological structures are different, practically speaking, and we consciously utilize a multi-dimensional psychological reality that you inherently possess but are unfamiliar with at an egotistical level.
从实际角度而言，我们的心理结构不同；我们有意识地利用一种多维度的心理现实，你本质上也拥有这种现实，但在自我层面上对此陌生。
It is natural then that our environment would have multi-dimensional qualities that the physical senses would never perceive.
因此，我们的环境自然会具有物理感官永远无法感知的多维特性。
Now I project a portion of my reality as I dictate this book to an undifferentiated level between systems that is relatively clear of camouflage.
现在，当我口述这本书时，我将自己现实的一部分投射到一个系统之间的非差异化层面，该层面相对没有伪装。
It is an inactive area, comparatively speaking.
相对而言，这是一个不活跃的区域。
If you were thinking in terms of physical reality then this area could be likened to one immediately above the atmosphere of your Earth.
如果你以物理现实来思考，那么这个区域可以被比作地球大气层正上方的某一区域。
However, I am speaking of psychological and psychic atmospheres, and this area is sufficiently distant from Rupert's physically oriented self so that the communications can be relatively understood.
然而，我说的是心理与精神氛围；该区域与鲁伯特那种以物质为导向的自我保持足够距离，因此交流相对容易被理解。
It is also, in a way, distant from my own environment, for in my own environment that would have some difficulties in relating information in physically oriented terms.
在某种程度上，它也与我的环境相去甚远，因为在我的环境中用以物质为导向的术语来表达信息会有困难。
We must understand that by distance I do not refer to space; creation and perception are far more intimately connected than any of your scientists realize.
我们必须明白，当我说“距离”时并不是指空间；创造与感知之间的联系比任何科学家想象的都更加密切。
It is quite true that your physical senses create the reality that they perceive.
的确，你的物理感官创造了它们所感知的现实。
A tree is something far different to a microbe, a bird, an insect and a man who stands beneath it.
树对微生物、鸟类、昆虫以及站在其下的人而言是完全不同的存在。
I am not saying that the tree only appears to be different; it is different.
我并不是说这棵树只是看起来不同；它确实不同。
You perceive as reality through one set of highly specialized senses, but this does not mean that its reality exists in that form in any more basic way than it exists in the form perceived by the microbe, insect or bird.
你通过一组高度专门化的感官来感知现实，但这并不意味着它的现实以这种形式存在得比微生物、昆虫或鸟类所感知到的形式更为根本。
You cannot perceive the quite valid reality of the tree in any context but your own; this applies to anything within the physical system that you know.
在除你自己之外的任何情境中，你都无法感知树的那种有效现实；这适用于你所知道的任何物理系统中的事物。
It is not that the physical reality is false; it is that the physical picture is simply one of an infinite number of ways of perceiving the various guises through which consciousness expresses itself.
这并不是说物理现实是虚假的；而是说物理图景只是意识表达自身的众多伪装方式之一。
The physical senses force you to translate experience into physical perceptions, while the inner senses open your range of perception and allow you to interpret experience in a far freer manner and to create new forms and new channels through which any consciousness can know itself.
物理感官迫使你将经验翻译为物理感知；而内在感官则打开了你的感知范围，使你能够以更自由的方式解释经验，并创造新的形式与通道，通过它们任何意识都可以认识自身。
Consciousness is, among other things, a spontaneous exercise in creativity.
意识除其他外，还是创造力的自发表现。
You are learning now, in a three-dimensional context, the ways in which your emotional and psychic existence can create varieties of physical form.
你现在正在在三维背景下学习情感与精神存在如何创造各种物质形态。
You manipulate within the psychic environment, and these manipulations are then automatically impressed upon the physical mold.
你在精神环境中进行操纵，而这些操作随后会自动印刻在物理模型上。
Now our environment is in itself creative in a different manner than yours: your environment is creative in that trees bear fruit and there is a self-sustaining principle, that the earth feeds its own, for example.
现在我们的环境本身以不同于你们的方式具有创造性：例如，你的环境通过树木结果体现出一种自我维持的原则，地球养育它的生物。
The naturally creative aspects are the materializations of the deepest psychic, spiritual, and physical inclinations of the species set up in your terms eons ago and forming a part of the racial bank of psychic knowledge.
自然创造性方面是物种最深层的心理、精神与物质倾向的物化，这些倾向早在你所说的亿万年前就已确立，并成为种族通灵知识库的一部分。
We endow the elements of our environment with an even greater creativity that is difficult to explain.
我们赋予环境中的元素一种难以解释的更大创造力。
We do not have flowers that grow, for example, but the intensity—the condensed psychic strength of our psychological natures—forms new dimensions of activity.
例如，我们没有会生长的花朵，但强度——我们心理本性中凝聚的精神力量——形成了新的活动维度。
If you paint a picture with a three-dimensional existence, then the painting must be on a flat surface, merely hinting at the complete three-dimensional experience that you cannot insert into it.
如果你用三维存在去绘画，那么画作必须在平面上，这只能暗示你无法完全置入其中的完整三维体验。
In our environment, however, we could actually create whatever dimensional effects we desired.
然而，在我们的环境中，我们实际上可以创造任何想要的维度效果。
All of these abilities are not ours alone; they are your heritage, as you will see later in this book.
所有这些能力并非只属于我们；它们也是你的遗产，正如你将在本书后面看到的。
You exercise your own inner senses and multi-dimensional abilities more frequently than it might seem, in other states of consciousness than the normal waking one.
在正常清醒状态之外的其他意识状态下，你比看上去更频繁地运用内在感官与多维能力。
Since my own environment does not have easily defined physical elements, you will be able to understand its nature by inference, as I explain related topics throughout this book.
由于我的环境没有容易定义的物理元素，你将能够通过推断来理解其本质，正如我在整本书中解释的相关主题。
Your own physical environment appears as it does to you because of your own psychological structure; if you gained your sense of personal continuity through associative processes primarily rather than as a result of the familiarity of self moving through time, then you would experience physical reality in an entirely different fashion.
你的物质环境之所以出现在你面前，是由你的心理结构决定；如果你主要通过联想过程获得个人连续感，而不是通过熟悉的自我穿越时间，那么你将以完全不同的方式体验物质现实。
Objects from past and present could be perceived at once, their presence justified through associative connections.
过去与现在的物体可以同时被感知，它们的存在可以通过联想联系得到证明。
Say that your father, throughout his lifetime, had eight favorite chairs; if your perceptive mechanisms were primarily set up as a result of intuitive association rather than time sequence, then you would perceive all of these chairs at one time, for seeing one you would be aware of the others.
比如说，你的父亲一生中有八把最喜欢的椅子；如果你的感知机制主要是通过直觉联想而非时间序列建立，那么你会同时感知到这些椅子；看到其中一把，你也会意识到其他几把。
So environment is not a separate thing in itself but the result of perceptive patterns, and these are determined by psychological structure.
因此，环境本身并非独立存在，而是感知模式的结果；这些模式由心理结构决定。
So if you want to know what my environment is like, you will have to understand what I am; in order to explain, I shall have to speak about the nature of consciousness in general, and in doing so I shall end up telling you much about yourself.
所以如果你想知道我的环境是什么样的，你必须理解我是什么；为了解释这一点，我将不得不泛谈意识的本质，在这样做的过程中我也会告诉你很多关于你自己的事情。
The inner portions of your identity are already aware of much that I will tell you; part of my purpose is to acquaint your egotistical self with knowledge that is already known to a larger portion of your own consciousness that you have long ignored.
你身份的内在部分已经意识到了我将要告诉你的许多事情；我的部分目的是让自负的自我认识到一个你长期忽视但为你更大意识部分所知的知识。
You look out into the physical universe and interpret reality according to the information received from your outer senses; I will stand, figuratively speaking, in physical reality and look inward for you and describe those realities of consciousness and experience that you are presently too fascinated to see.
你眺望物质宇宙，并根据外在感官接收的信息来解释现实；打个比方，我将站在物质现实中为你向内观察，并描述那些你现在因过度着迷而无法看到的意识与体验的现实。
For you were fascinated with physical reality, and you are in as deep a trance now as the woman is through whom I write this book; all of your attention is focused in a highly specialized way upon one shining bright point that you call reality.
因为你对物质现实着迷，如同我通过其写这本书的那位女性如今深陷恍惚；你的全部注意力以高度专注的方式集中在你所谓的现实这一闪亮点上。
There are other realities all about you, but you ignore their existence and you plot out all stimuli that come from them; there is a reason for such a trance, as you will discover, but little by little you must wake up.
在你周围存在其他现实，但你忽视了它们的存在，并绘制出所有来自它们的刺激；这种恍惚是有原因的，你将逐渐发现，但你必须一点一点地醒来。
My purpose is to open your inner eyes; my environment occludes, of course, those other personalities with whom I come in contact, and communication, perception and environment can hardly be separated.
我的目的是开启你内心的眼睛；我的环境当然会遮蔽我接触过的其他人格，而交流、感知与环境几乎无法分开。
Therefore, the kind of communication that is carried on by myself and my associates is extremely important in any discussion of our environment.
因此，我和同伴所进行的交流在讨论我们环境时极为重要。
In the following chapter, I hope to give you an idea, quite simply, of our existence, the work in which we are involved, the dimension in which we exist, the purposes that we hold dear and, most of all, of those concerns that make up our experience.
在接下来的章节中，我希望能简单地向你介绍我们的存在、我们所从事的工作、我们所处的维度、我们所珍视的宗旨，以及构成我们经验的那些关切。
